## Create a search pipe to dynamically filter results with Angular-2
A very common use case of this is to have an input box where a user enters a search text and the results are filtered appropriately.
In our application was necessary to integrate a filter in order to make it easy to search for a Project, because sometimes looking for a Project among hundreds of these can be very annoying.

### 1- Create the Filter Pipe
For pipe creation we use the following command:
```sh
$ ng g pipe filter-text
```
Letâ€™s populate the pipe with code for the filter, Here is the code:

This code will return a subset of an array of _Projects_ if any project contains the searchText string in its property _title_. In the future we can extend our code to expand the search on other properties such as the category etc.

### 2- Use the Filter Pipe
In order to use the pipe, first we imported it into the app module and we created _Input_ box into the _explore-projects.component.html_ and including  _Two-way Binding_ using _ngModel_ directive, this allows the Project model _text_ variable to update the input when it changes and listen for changes on the input as well. Here is the code:
<p align="center"><img width="90%" src="project-documentation/screenshots/input-search.png"></p>

Then we included our filter in the _projects_ list into _ngFor_ directive. Here is the code:
<p align="center"><img width="90%" src="project-documentation/screenshots/include-pipe-ngFor.png"></p>

### 3- Results
Now we should see an input box and below the table that contains some data of the projects.

If we type some text into the box and see that our list being dynamically filtered!

## Authentication  using Angular 2 and Firebase.
I was very curious about how the user authentication process works using Firebase and Angular 2, so I stopped to consult updated bibliography about the topic and try to implement the user authentication process on the Crowdfunding application.
Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to our app. It supports authentication using passwords, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, Github etc.
### 1- Getting ready
The first thing we have to do is make sure to install angularfire2 and for that we use the following command:
```sh
$ npm install angularfire2 firebase --save
```
Then make sure to make the necessary configurations in our file _src/app/app.module.ts_ to import the important classes that will provide us some necessary methods and properties that will intervene in the user authentication process.

### 2- Create an auth service to implement the authentication
In our auth.service.ts file, we imported AngularFireAuth, firebase and Observable also we created an observable user variable, injected FirebaseAuth in the constructor.
The following image shows a capture of the source code of our service.

 Then we implemented methods that allow authentication using Facebook, Twitter, Google and we also include the isLoggedIn () and Logout () methods.
 The following image shows a capture of the source code of our service.

### 3- Create login component.
In our login.component.ts file we imported the AuthService, injected it in the constructor and implemented signInWithTwitter(), signInWithFacebook() and signInWithGoogle() methods.
The following image shows a capture of the source code of our login component.

In our login.component.html file we added click functions for each buttons. See the code below:

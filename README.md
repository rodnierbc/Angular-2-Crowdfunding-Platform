## Create a search pipe to dynamically filter results with Angular-2
A very common use case of this is to have an input box where a user enters a search text and the results are filtered appropriately.
In our application was necessary to integrate a filter in order to make it easy to search for a Project, because sometimes looking for a Project among hundreds of these can be very annoying.

### 1- Create the Filter Pipe
For pipe creation we use the following command:
```sh
$ ng g pipe filter-text
```
Letâ€™s populate the pipe with code for the filter, Here is the code:

<p align="center"><img width="90%" src="project-documentation/screenshots/filter-text-pipe.png"></p>

This code will return a subset of an array of _Projects_ if any project contains the searchText string in its property _title_. In the future we can extend our code to expand the search on other properties such as the category etc.

### 2- Use the Filter Pipe
In order to use the pipe, first we imported it into the app module and we created _Input_ box into the _explore-projects.component.html_ and including  _Two-way Binding_ using _ngModel_ directive, this allows the Project model _text_ variable to update the input when it changes and listen for changes on the input as well. Here is the code:
<p align="center"><img width="90%" src="project-documentation/screenshots/input-search.png"></p>

Then we included our filter in the _projects_ list into _ngFor_ directive. Here is the code:
<p align="center"><img width="90%" src="project-documentation/screenshots/include-pipe-ngFor.png"></p>

### 3- Results
Now we should see an input box and below the table that contains some data of the projects.

If we type some text into the box and see that our list being dynamically filtered!
